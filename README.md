This project is an android port of the [emoji4j](https://github.com/kcthota/emoji4j) which is a java library to convert short codes, html entities to emojis and vice-versa. Also supports parsing emoticons, surrogate html entities.

Inspired by [vdurmont/emoji-java](https://github.com/vdurmont/emoji-java), emoji4j adds more goodies and helpers to deal with emojis. The emoji data is based on the database from [github/gemoji](https://github.com/github/gemoji) and ASCII emoticons data from [wooorm/emoticon](https://github.com/wooorm/emoticon).

###### This project is already being used in [AniTrend](https://anitrend.co/)

# Known Issues

- Converting of html entities to emojies may not always display the emoji on a given android device if the target device does not have the suggested emoticons e.g. android 4.3 does not have some emoticons available in android 5.0+

# Suggestions

- Depending on the complexity of the string passed the conversion may take a second or two which may make your application jitter, I strongly suggest doing conversions in a background thread. This could be between sending a network request or recieving it.
- If you are using a markdown library like __[txtmark](https://github.com/rjeschke/txtmark)__ or using just ```Html.fromHtml()```  you can skip convertion of __HexHtml & HtmlCodes__ to emoji and just pass the returned  __[Spanned](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/Spanned.html)__ from the ```Html.fromHtml``` to your text view. (See sample in project)

# Use Case

Got a social application but you need someway of having emoji support? Then this library is for you, all your backend stores is the html entities. Your client application would have to convert all emoji objects in a given string and transmit that to your server. When the client request status or blog text it has to convert the html entities to emoji objects which your android operating system will resolve. See examples below!

# Getting Started

### Step 1. Add this to your root build.gradle:

```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

### Step 2. Add the dependency:

```
dependencies {
	compile 'com.github.wax911:android-emojify:{latest_version}'
}

```

### Step 3. Create an application class in your android project and add:

Don't know how to do that?? Take a look at the [application class example](https://github.com/wax911/android-emojify/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/wax911/emojifysample/App.java)

```
public class App extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        EmojiManager.initEmojiData(getApplicationContext());
    }
}

```

# Examples:

## getEmoji

Get emoji by unicode, short code, decimal or hexadecimal html entity

```
Emoji emoji = EmojiUtils.getEmoji("üê≠"); //get emoji by unicode character

EmojiUtils.getEmoji("blue_car").getEmoji(); //returns üöô

EmojiUtils.getEmoji(":blue_car:").getEmoji(); //also returns üöô

EmojiUtils.getEmoji("&#x1f42d;").getEmoji(); //returns üê≠

EmojiUtils.getEmoji("&#128045;").getEmoji(); //also returns üê≠

EmojiUtils.getEmoji("&#55357;&#56833;").getEmoji(); //returns üòÅ

```

## The Emoji Object

Conversion from unicode, short code, hexadecimal and decimal html entities is pretty easy.

```
Emoji emoji = EmojiUtils.getEmoji("üê≠");

emoji.getEmoji(); //returns üê≠

emoji.getDecimalHtml(); //returns &#128045;

emoji.getHexHtml(); //return &#x1f42d;

emoji.getAliases(); //returns a collection of aliases. ["mouse"]

```

## isEmoji

Verifies if the passed string is an emoji character

```
EmojiUtils.isEmoji("üê≠"); //returns true
